DONE:
- implement the observer pattern for mainwindow_notification
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/328365/Understanding-and-Implementing-Observer-Pattern
- we want: when the message changes (in mainwindow, signup dialog, signin dialog, etc), we want to update the message in errorpopup, and popup the error popup (NO LONGER USE MAINWINDOW_NOTIFICATION)
- in MessageSubject: the objects in the list should be type ErrorPopup because we're updating errorpopup
- attach errorpopup in mainwindow, signup dialog, signin dialog, or wherever (right after errorpopup is newed)
